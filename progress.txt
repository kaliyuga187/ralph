- Implemented Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
- Configured Tailwind CSS with custom brand colors (brand, success, urgent)
- Created folder structure: /app, /components, /lib, /types
- Set up basic layout and home page
- Files created:
  - aerial-platform/package.json (with Next.js scripts)
  - aerial-platform/tsconfig.json
  - aerial-platform/tailwind.config.ts
  - aerial-platform/postcss.config.mjs
  - aerial-platform/next.config.ts
  - aerial-platform/app/layout.tsx
  - aerial-platform/app/page.tsx
  - aerial-platform/app/globals.css
  - aerial-platform/.gitignore
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js 16.1.4 automatically updates tsconfig.json on first dev run
  - Tailwind 4.x is being used (latest version)
  - Dev server starts on port 3000 by default
  - TypeScript strict mode is enabled
