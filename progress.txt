## Codebase Patterns

- Tailwind CSS 4.x requires @tailwindcss/postcss plugin (not the old tailwindcss plugin)
- Use "use client" directive for components with hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Custom colors defined in tailwind.config.ts: brand, success, urgent

- Implemented Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
- Configured Tailwind CSS with custom brand colors (brand, success, urgent)
- Created folder structure: /app, /components, /lib, /types
- Set up basic layout and home page
- Files created:
  - aerial-platform/package.json (with Next.js scripts)
  - aerial-platform/tsconfig.json
  - aerial-platform/tailwind.config.ts
  - aerial-platform/postcss.config.mjs
  - aerial-platform/next.config.ts
  - aerial-platform/app/layout.tsx
  - aerial-platform/app/page.tsx
  - aerial-platform/app/globals.css
  - aerial-platform/.gitignore
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js 16.1.4 automatically updates tsconfig.json on first dev run
  - Tailwind 4.x is being used (latest version)
  - Dev server starts on port 3000 by default
  - TypeScript strict mode is enabled

- Created aggressive marketing landing page with conversion-focused design
- Components built:
  - Hero: Bold headline "Get 5 Local Bids in 24 Hours" with dual-path CTAs
  - UrgencyBanner: Rotating urgency messages (5s interval)
  - SocialProof: Animated counter showing 10,000+ jobs completed
  - HowItWorks: Tabbed interface for client vs contractor workflows
- Files created:
  - aerial-platform/components/Hero.tsx
  - aerial-platform/components/SocialProof.tsx
  - aerial-platform/components/HowItWorks.tsx
  - aerial-platform/components/UrgencyBanner.tsx
- Files modified:
  - aerial-platform/app/page.tsx (integrated all marketing components)
  - aerial-platform/postcss.config.mjs (fixed for Tailwind 4.x)
  - aerial-platform/package.json (added @tailwindcss/postcss)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind CSS 4.x requires @tailwindcss/postcss instead of tailwindcss in PostCSS config
  - Client components need "use client" directive for React hooks
  - Animated counters use setInterval with cleanup in useEffect
  - Tab switchers use conditional rendering based on state
  - All components are fully responsive (mobile-first design)
  - Production build passes all checks
