## 💡 Pro Tips

**For Best Results:**

1. **Prioritize audio quality** - Viewers forgive mediocre video, but bad audio kills engagement
2. **Keep it tight** - Every second counts. Cut ruthlessly.
3. **Test on mobile** - 70% of video views are mobile. Ensure text is readable.
4. **Add captions** - 85% of social videos watched muted. Burn in subtitles or use platform captions.
5. **Create variants** - Different platforms need different aspect ratios. Export 16:9, 9:16, and 1:1.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- ❌ Music too loud (drown out voiceover)
- ❌ Text too small (unreadable on phone)
- ❌ Too fast pacing (viewers can't absorb)
- ❌ Inconsistent branding (colors off, wrong logo)
- ❌ File too large (slow loading, poor UX)

---

## 🏆 Success Metrics

**A successful video will:**

- ✅ Completion rate >60% (YouTube Analytics)
- ✅ Click-through rate >5% to GitHub
- ✅ Positive comments > negative (social proof)
- ✅ Shares >100 across all platforms
- ✅ GitHub stars increase by 50+ (if open source)

**Stretch goals:**
