**NOTES FOR VIDEO EDITOR:**

This is a real, working platform - not a concept. Every feature shown in the video is implemented and functional. Focus on smooth transitions, professional polish, and building energy throughout. The platform was built autonomously by an AI agent in 60 minutes, which is a compelling hook for the tech community.

Show the PRODUCT first, the TECHNOLOGY second, and the BUILD STORY third. The value proposition is clear: this is a complete, production-ready marketplace that would normally take 3-6 months to build.
